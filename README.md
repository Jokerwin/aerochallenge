## Tech Stack
* Vue.js + Vuex + Vue Router
* Ant Design + Bootstrap
* Font Awesome + Icomoon

## How to continue this work and other ideas
* Documentation. Documentation is important.
* Testing. Same point as the before.
* Bag could persist in the browser session i.e. using LocalStorage
* Product detail. You don't buy or redeem something without see in details the product before.
* Filter products that I can redeem with the points that I have right now. Very easy to implement but I just came up with.
* Pagination. 20-30 products per page is ok.
* Redeem History in another dedicated page. For simplicity I put it in a dropdown but definitely it has to be in another section.
* Placeholders! It could be nice that until all the requests to the API be completed, show products placeholders.
