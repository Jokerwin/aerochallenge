# Aerolab Coding Challenge 

## Installation

* Install latest node.js: https://nodejs.org​
* Install latest yarn package manager: https://yarnpkg.com/​
* Install node modules by running terminal command `yarn install`
* Run the app `yarn serve`
* Visit the URL that you see in the console i.e. http://localhost:8080

## Tech Stack
* Vue.js + Vuex + Vue Router
* Ant Design + Bootstrap
* Font Awesome + Icomoon

## How to continue this work and other ideas
* **Documentation**. Documentation is important.
* **Testing**. Same point as the before.
* **Bag** could persist in the browser session i.e. using LocalStorage
* **Product detail**. You don't buy or redeem something without see in details the product before.
* **Filter products that I can redeem** with the points that I have right now. Very easy to implement but I just came up with.
* **Pagination**. 20-30 products per page is ok.
* **Redeem History in another dedicated page**. For simplicity I put it in a dropdown but definitely it has to be in another section.
* **Placeholders!** It could be nice that until all the requests to the API be completed, show products placeholders.
